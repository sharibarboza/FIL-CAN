  The formation of the Filipino-Canadian Seventh-Day Adventists of Alberta
  started way back when Edmonton Central SDA Church started celebrating
  Independence Day under the encouragement of Pastor John Wesley.

  In early 2002, this became a reality when Pastor Romulo Daquila accepted a
  call to become the Executive Secretary of the Alberta Conference. At that time
  there was no organized Filipino SDA congregation. He called a meeting in
  August 2002. The meeting was held in the conference office at Red Deer. Dr.
  Nimrod Montano was elected as the first president, George Vashisda as the
  first secretary, and Ben Barboza as the first treasurer. The very first FILCAN
  Camp Meeting was on August 22, 2003 led by the Edmonton group.
